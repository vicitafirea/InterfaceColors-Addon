# InterfaceColors-Addon
Addon designed to work as a replacement of the default World of Warcraft's interface colors for each Reputation level, Class colors, Quest Difficulty color &amp; Level Number color in the Target's frame. Used and was functional in TurtleWoW.

Slash command is /interfacecolors, there are options to change the class colors back to default vanilla colors, retail/Dragonflight modern colors, default Hearthstone colors, brighter (less opaque) Hearthstone colors & TBC colors (default vanilla but shaman color is light blue instead).
